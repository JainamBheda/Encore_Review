# PWM Generator Circuit using Op-Amp (DC Motor controller)

## Overview

This document describes an analog PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) circuit designed to generate a PWM signal with a frequency of 500 Hz and a variable duty cycle ranging from 20% to 90%. The output signal is suitable for driving a MOSFET to control the speed of a DC motor.

## Features

- PWM Frequency: 500 Hz
- Duty Cycle Range: 20% to 90%
- Adjustable Duty Cycle: A potentiometer allows for easy  
  adjustment of the duty cycle.

## Circuit Description
The circuit primarily consists of the following components:

- Operational Amplifier (Op-Amp): Used as a comparator.
- Potentiometer: For adjusting the reference voltage, affecting the duty cycle.
- Resistors and Capacitors: Form a timing circuit to set the PWM frequency and shape the waveform.
- MOSFET: Acts as a switch for controlling the DC motor.

## How to Use

- Assemble the Circuit: Use the provided schematic to build the PWM generator circuit on a breadboard or PCB.
- Adjust the Duty Cycle: Turn the potentiometer to change the reference voltage fed to the op-amp, thus varying the duty cycle between 20% and 90%.
- Connect to MOSFET: Connect the PWM output to the gate of a suitable MOSFET, which will control the speed of the DC motor.

## Calculating Duty Cycle
- To set the duty cycle, the reference voltage at the inverting input can be adjusted via R2. The duty cycle

## Component Selection
Ensure that the MOSFET can handle the current of the DC motor.
Select an op-amp with a suitable power supply range and speed.
Capacitor values may be adjusted for fine-tuning the frequency.
Adjusting Duty Cycle
To achieve a duty cycle between 20% and 90%, adjust R2 while monitoring the PWM output with an oscilloscope.
Ensure that the reference voltage corresponds to the desired duty cycle percentage.

## Conclusion
This PWM generator circuit using an op-amp provides a flexible solution for controlling the speed of a DC motor through MOSFET switching. By following the guidelines above, you can build and adjust the circuit to meet your specific requirements.

## Safety Precautions
Ensure proper heat dissipation for the MOSFET to avoid thermal failure.
Verify all connections before powering up the circuit.
